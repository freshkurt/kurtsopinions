# Awakening

Hey there,
it's been a while since my first blog post. Part of the problem was lack of time but the other part was a technical challenge. I had difficulties pushing my changes to github.  

First of all I had to fight to commit all my changes to my branch. The command `git commit` didn't work as expected as no changes were getting picked up. A short google search later `git commit -a` did the trick for me. The tougher problem I faced was pushing my changes to github. I had difficulties to connect to my github account. It turned out that I need to create a personal access token, because of the 2FA I have in place. Unfortunately I didn't got it to work until recently.  

I now plan to post more regularly. Stay tuned.
